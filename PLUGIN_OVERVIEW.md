Long agent responses often need several separate comments: refine one step in a plan, question part of an implementation proposal, or remove a section from a generated draft. Inline Review keeps each instruction attached to the exact passage it concerns, then delivers the complete review as one readable message.

## Review as you read

Select exact text in an assistant response and choose **Feedback** from BB's native selection menu. Add a **Comment** or mark the passage for **Remove** without leaving the thread. Return saves a comment, while Shift+Return inserts a new line.

## Keep the source visible

Staged comments remain marked with a yellow underline and removals with a red strike-through. The compact feedback editor leaves the surrounding response visible. After navigation or a page reload, Inline Review restores a highlight only when it finds one unique visible assistant-text match, while tolerating Markdown layout whitespace. Ambiguous quotes remain safely stored in the review without highlighting the wrong passage.

## Build one revision request

The collapsed **Feedback** banner appears after the first annotation. Expand it to edit or remove items, add Overall feedback, clear the draft, or submit everything together. Enter adds a line to Overall feedback; Ctrl+Enter or ⌘+Enter sends the review. **Send feedback** creates one numbered message in the same thread so the agent receives the quotations and instructions as one revision request.

## Storage and requirements

Each thread has its own server-side draft. Drafts survive navigation, browser reloads, and BB restarts. Inline Review uses no external service and requires no additional account. It supports BB 0.43.1 and later with Plugin SDK 0.4.87 or later.

## Focused scope

Inline Review annotates assistant-message text. It does not annotate user messages or files, and it never changes the original response. A **Remove** item asks the agent to omit or disregard the quoted material in its revision; it does not delete text from thread history. Browsers without the CSS Custom Highlight API retain feedback capture, persistence, review, and delivery without passage coloring.
